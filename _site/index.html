        <p>Hello! This is Apurv Sonawane from VJTI, Mumbai. This is the first time I’ll be applying for GSoC. After going through a vast array of Organisations and learning about their projects, I finally found “<em>GSOC LMS Portal for Drupal</em>” project of <strong>Drupal</strong> quite interesting.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>I joined Slack and began digging deeper into the projects. I completed the setup locally. I'm creating this blog to summarise my path of developing a LMS prototype as a pre-proposal task.</p>

<h3 id="1-building-drupal-and-running-it-locally">1. Building Drupal and running it locally</h3>
<ul> 
  <li>First I followed the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/local-server-setup/windows-development-environment/quick-install-drupal-with-xampp-on">Local Setup using XAMPP</a>, which involved installing it using xampp. I performed all the steps but I got an error about the PHP version.</li>
  <li>After some days, I found another setup option using ddev. I did the docker installation by following this <a href="https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/install/docker-installation/#docker-desktop-for-windows">this</a>.
  <li>I tried all the steps mentioned on Stack Overflow to get rid of this error but I could not find any solution. Then, I installed ddev using this particular <a href="https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/install/ddev-installation/">Link</a>.
  <li>After all the installation, I had to run the following commands:</br>
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
    </code></pre></div></div>
    mkdir my-drupal10-site
    cd my-drupal10-site
    ddev config --project-type=drupal10 --docroot=web --create-docroot
    ddev start
    ddev composer create drupal/recommended-project
    ddev composer require drush/drush
    ddev drush site:install --account-name=admin --account-pass=admin -y
    ddev drush uli
    ddev launch
</code></pre></div></div>
  </li>
<li>I also followed this <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/installing-drupal/building-a-drupal-site-with-git/">Link</a> to get the code from git and running it locally.
</ul>

<h3 id="2-a-simple-webapp-demonstraing-web-components-using-react-storybook">2. A simple webapp demonstrating mini-LMS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I started by deciding the tech stack to be used, and listing out basic functionalities that an LMS must have.</li>
  <li>As I am quite proficient at the full stack technologies like MERN-Stack, I decided to built my project using MERN Stack.</li>
  <li>I began by creating a basic react app using the command.</li>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npx create-react-app client
  </code></pre></div></div>
  <li>I decided to develop the basic landing page for the starters.
  </li>
  <li>Later I focused on working on the Authentication part.</li>
  <li>For authentication, I used the JWT token. Brcypt.Js was used for hashing the password.</li>
  <li>When it comes to developing different components, initially I began by creating the basic components first. First of all, I developed the navbar and the sidebar using React. </li>
  <li>I began working on the other components, starting with the calender for which, I used FullCalender React Component. I installed dependencies by</li>
  <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm i @fullcalendar/react
  </code></pre></div></div>
  <li>I used Moment for date and time to display in human readable format.</li>
  <li>After successfully implementing the calender functionality, I went on for the Tasks page where all the tasks would be listed as well as user can add new tasks. For this functionality, I used Axios to make HTTP requests, browseHistory and Redirect from react-router-dom. The same was used to implement the Goals functionality.</li>
  <li>Later I developed the conferencing functionality. Here Socket.Io was used so that client can send and receive messages in real-time with the server. UUIDs are used to uniquely identify entities. @chatscope/chat-ui-kit-react, a library of React components is used to build chat user interfaces quickly and easily.</li>
  <li>Moving on with the flowchart functionality, flowchart.js is used for creating and rendering flowcharts. For the editor, I've used AceEditor which I imported from the react-ace. AceEditor component is used to create an instance of the Ace code editor within a React application. The same was used for the Editor functionality as well.</li>
  <li>Later on moving on with the code collaborators functionality, I've used  judge0 api. Its a free and open source online code editor that allows you to write and execute code</li>
  <li>Simple peer was used to transfer files over rtc and to connect multiple people over a video call.</li>
